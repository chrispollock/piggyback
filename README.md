# Piggyback

Piggyback is a proof of concept project exploring the possibilities of hosting websites and files through DNS TXT records.

Each record is allowed up to 255 characters. This means any string of characters can be broken down into chunks and stored as records.

Got a website? Push it up, wait for it to propagate, and you've just deployed to the most reliable globally distributed infrastructure money can buy at zero cost!
